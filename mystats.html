        <h3>FAVOURITE FOOD - Tandoori Chicken</h3>
        <p>The chicken is marinated with Indian spices and baked in a clay oven creating a juicy and a delicious flavour. If people are new to Indian food, Tandoori chicken is a must try dish. If people are into seafood, then Tandoori fish is the option to opt for.</p>
